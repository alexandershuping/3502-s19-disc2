Problem 1
[a]: What is the signature of the following method:

public int addPotatoes(int potatoesToAdd){
  this.potatoes += potatoesToAdd;
  return this.potatoes;
}


[b]: What would change about this method if I replaced both instances of
     `this.potatoes` with `potatoes` (assuming that `potatoes` is a
     property of the class in which `addPotatoes` is defined)?


[c]: Consider the following method:

public boolean tomatoThePotatoes(int tomatoes){
  boolean myPotatoes = (potatoes > 3 || --potatoes == 0) 
                       && !(potatoes != 1 && false);

  myPotatoes &= (tomatoes == potatoes);
  return myPotatoes;
}

Assume that this method is part of a class called `PotatoBasket`, which
has a property `potatoes`, a default constructor, and an initialization
constructor. The following code is run:

  PotatoBasket thePotatoes = new PotatoBasket(4);
  boolean didItWork = thePotatoes.tomatoThePotatoes(4);
  didItWork = thePotatoes.tomatoThePotatoes(4);

What is the value of didItWork after the second line? The third line?
If they are different, why?
